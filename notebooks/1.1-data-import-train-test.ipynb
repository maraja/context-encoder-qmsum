'cause they 're used most and so they should be robust . they should n't break down easily . um then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room , it might be and i say might be because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot . but it might be a good idea to make a docking station . and this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep . so you 'd know where it is in the room . and in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an l_c_d_ screen in the remote control would be preferred . this was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . but up till forty five it remains feasible . this would also greatly increase the production costs but i think these are just some small factors we could consider .\",\n",

'kay these are some more group specific findings . uh the older people prefer dark colours . uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . and our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people . um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have . um this leads us to some personal preferences . uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room . um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . just keep it simple and well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the these would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control . so this would be very important that we at least include these features . um well the trend-watchers i consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . so you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . this is not really this is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . so they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . so it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . the wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . people with more money . uh the grey-black colour for well people with less means . that would be all .\",\n",
